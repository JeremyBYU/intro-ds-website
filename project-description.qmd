## Introduction

**TL;DR**: *Pick a data set and do a regression or classification analysis.*

The goal of the final project is for you to use data science methods to analyze data of your choosing. The data should broadly connect to topics you studied in the [Core Curriculum](http://catalog.springfield.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=88&poid=4256) (first-year seminar, foundations for the future and understanding the world domains, and the themed explorations). The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way. 

This project will be your Core Capstone work. A Core Capstone Work is an assignment (or set of assignments) in studentsâ€™ major capstone/seminar course where students integrate their Core Curriculum coursework with their major course work. Students will use their collected Signature Assignments (one assignment from each Core course, collected in Brightspace ePortfolios) to help in this work. This Core Capstone work will have six (6) deliverables that fulfill the learning outcomes of the Core Capstone.

<!-- Choose the data based on your interests and topics you have covered in other core classes (first-year seminar, foundations for the future and understanding the world domains, and the themed explorations) -->

## Deliverables

The six deliverables for the final project are

-   Topic Ideas - Identify 2-3 data sets that connect with the topics you covered in the Core Curriculum. Write a brief report of the data (Core Capstone Work LO1 and L02).
-   Proposal - Begin your analysis of your chosen dataset and its connection with two (2) of your signature assignments (Core Capstone Work LO1 and L02)
-   Draft Report - First draft of your final report (Core Capstone Work LO1 and LO2)
-   Peer Review - Formal peer review on another students project. This will provide important feedback to others and provide you an opportunity to serve and aid others (Core Capstone Work LO3).
-   Final Report - A written, reproducible report detailing your analysis (Core Capstone Work LO1).  Include an ending discussion of how your coursework has helped you to be a leader in service to others (Core Capstone Work LO3)
-   Final Presentation - A brief 7-10 minutes presentation that summarizes your work (Core Capstone Work LO1).


All analyses must be done in Jupyter Notebooks stored in a shared Google Drive Folder. All components of the project **must be reproducible** (written in Google Collab notebook), except the presentation. The template for all deliverables can be found in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17c7UofE8xHG9ZQGrmgxi7q7-JpnlXLHd?usp=sharing). You should copy each template component into your shared google drive folder and complete the assignment. 

## Topic ideas {#topic-ideas}

Identify 2-3 data sets you're interested in potentially using for the final project that connect with the topics you covered in the Core Curriculum.
If you're unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources in the [Tips + Resources](./project-tips-resources.qmd) section as a starting point. Example project ideas and datasets can be found in the [Example Project Ideas](#example-project-ideas) section.
It may also help to think of topics you're interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.

The purpose of submitting project ideas is to give you time to find data for the project and to make sure you have a data set that can help you be successful in the project.
**Therefore, you must use one of the data sets submitted as a topic idea, unless otherwise notified by me.**

The data sets should meet the following criteria:

-   At least 100 observations

-   At least 7 columns

-   At least 6 of the columns must be useful and unique predictor variables.

    -   Identifier variables such as "name", "social security number", etc. are not useful predictor variables.
    -   If you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. "state abbreviation" and "state name"), then they are not unique predictors.

-   At least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable

    -   The response variable can be quantitative or categorical.
    -   **This is the most important part of the dataset! Please identify this variable (column) and be clear that it is your response variable in your topic idea report!**

-   A mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.

-   Observations should reasonably meet the independence condition.
    Therefore, avoid data with repeated measures, data collected over time, etc.


**Please ask me if you're unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.**

Please write a report in the file `topic-ideas.ipynb` which is in you shared Google Drive folder. Include the following:

#### Introduction and data

-   State the source of the data set.
-   Describe when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).
-   Describe the observations and the general characteristics being measured in the data.
-   Describe how the data set connect to your Core Studies.

#### Research question

-   Describe a research question you're interested in answering using this data. Remember the main focus of this class is to make a *predictive* model. You shoud frame the question as, "Can one reliabily predict X from Y". Where X is some column in your dataset and Y are 6 or more different columns in your dataset.

#### Glimpse of data

-   Use the `info` function to provide an overview of each data set

Print your Jupyter notebook as PDF and submit to Brightspace

#### Save Dataset

Please save each dataset in the `data` folder in your Google Drive Folder.

## Project proposal {#project-proposal}

Please write a report in the file `project-proposal.ipynb` which is in you shared Google Drive folder.

The purpose of the project proposal is to help you think about your analysis strategy early. Here is a link to a [sample proposal](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/114Xx14ThCd0e6w2Kk_WfGDK4r2zJ4a9o?usp=sharing)

Include the following in the proposal:

### Section 1 - Introduction

The introduction section includes

-   an introduction to the subject matter you're investigating
-   the motivation for your research question (citing any relevant literature)
-   briefly describe its connection to Core classes
-   the general research question you wish to explore
-   your hypotheses regarding the research question of interest.

### Section 2 - Data description

In this section, you will describe the data set you wish to explore.
This includes

-   description of the observations in the data set,
-   description of how the data was originally collected (not how you found the data but how the original curator of the data collected it).

### Section 3 - Analysis approach

In this section, you will provide a brief overview of your analysis approach.
This includes:

-   Description of the response variable.
-   Visualization and summary statistics for the response variable.
-   List of variables that will be considered as predictors
-   Model selection (linear regresssion, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, etc.)
    - Explain which models *might* be suitable for making predictions


### Section 4 - Connect to Core Capstone Work

Describe how this dataset and analysis will connect with at least two (2) your signature assignments from the Core (Core Capstone Work LO2)

- Describe each signature assignment 
- Describe how the dataset and analysis builds upon or connects with your prior work

Example: You took Philosphy 106 (ethics) and you discussed the relationship between employers and employees. You submitted a signature assignment of a paper on unions (pro or against, it doesn't matter). A possible dataset you could choose 
is the [Right to Work Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandonconrady/right-to-work-dataset) and do an analysis on the relationship between state laws and their effect on union participation.

**NOTE** - If you are a senior/junior and are are **not** particpating in the new Core you will not have any signature assignments. In this case, just describe in general how your dataset might connect with any general studies/core classes. I am leaving this **very** open.


### Section 5 - Data dictionary (aka code book)

In this section, you will create a markdown table that describes each varible in the dataset. Put your data in the `data` folder.
Link to this file from your proposal writeup.


### Submission

Print your Jupyter notebook as a PDF and submit to Brightspace.

### Proposal grading

| Total                | 15 pts |
|----------------------|--------|
| **Introduction**     | 5 pts  |
| **Data description** | 4 pts  |
| **Analysis plan**    | 4 pts  |
| **Connect Core**     | 1 pts  |
| **Data dictionary**  | 1 pts  |

Each component will be graded as follows:

-   **Meets expectations (full credit)**: All required elements are completed and are accurate.
    The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.

-   **Close to expectations (half credit)**: There are some elements missing and/or inaccurate.
    There are some issues with formatting.

-   **Does not meet expectations (no credit)**: Major elements missing.
    Work is not neatly formatted and would not be presentable in a professional setting.

## Draft report {#draft-report}

The purpose of the draft and peer review is to give you an opportunity to get early feedback on your analysis.
Therefore, the draft and peer review will focus primarily on the exploratory data analysis, modeling, and initial interpretations.

Write the draft in the **written-report.ipynb** file in your shared Google Drive folder.

Below is a brief description of the sections to focus on in the draft:

### Introduction and data

This section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Include this papers connection to at least two core classes.
Describe the data and definitions of key variables.
It should also include some exploratory data analysis (EDA).
All of the EDA won't fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.

### Methodology

This section includes a brief description of your modeling process.
Explain the reasoning for the type of model you're fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions.
Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, any variable transformations (if needed), and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.

### Results and Discussion

In this section, you will output the final model and include a brief discussion of the model assumptions, diagnostics, and any relevant model fit statistics. If you are doing a classificaiton problem please include a confusion matrix.

This section also includes initial interpretations and conclusions drawn from the model.

**Submission**

Print your Jupyter notebook as a PDF and submit to Brightspace.


## Peer review {#peer-review}

Critically reviewing others' work is a crucial part of the scientific process.
Each invidual/team will be assigned two other teams's projects to review.
Each team should have finished their draft report by the due date.
A class period in the following week will be dedicated to the peer review, and all reviews will be due by the end of that class session.

The peer review will be graded on the extent to which it comprehensively and constructively addresses the components of the partner team's report: the research context and motivation, exploratory data analysis, modeling, interpretations, and conclusions.

I will assign which two teams your team will reivew shortely before the peer reivew process begins


### Process and questions

Write your reviews inside your shared Google Drive folder called `peer-review`. Inside will be two Google documents for you to fill out for each team you review. Please ensure each review has the following:

    -   Names of team members that participated in this review: \[FULL NAMES OF TEAM MEMBERS DOING THE REVIEW\]

    -   Describe the goal of the project.

    -   Describe the data used or collected, if any.
        If the proposal does not include the use of a specific dataset, comment on whether the project would be strengthened by the inclusion of a dataset.

    -   Describe the approaches, tools, and methods that will be used.

    -   Is there anything that is unclear from the proposal?

    -   Provide constructive feedback on how the team might be able to improve their project.
        Make sure your feedback includes at least one comment on the statistical modeling aspect of the project, but do feel free to comment on aspects beyond the modeling.

    -   What aspect of this project are you most interested in and would like to see highlighted in the presentation.

    -   Provide constructive feedback on any issues with file and/or code organization.

    -   (Optional) Any further comments or feedback?


**Submission**

Print your Google Docs as a PDF and submit to Brightspace. You should have two uploads for each team you review.

## Final report {#final-report}

Your written report must be completed in the `written-report.ipynb` file and must be reproducible.
All team members should contribute to the report

**You will submit the PDF of your final report on Brightspace.**

The mandatory components of the report are below.
You are free to add additional sections as necessary.
The report, including visualizations, should be **no more than 10 pages long.** is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.

Be selective in what you include in your final write-up.
The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.

You are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report.
You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report.
The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate.
It is not included in the 10-page limit.

The written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows

| Total                         | 40 pts |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| **Introduction/data**         | 6 pts  |
| **Methodology**               | 10 pts |
| **Results**                   | 14 pts |
| **Discussion + conclusion**   | 6 pts  |
| **Organization + formatting** | 4 pts  |

The model selection process  addressed any violations in model conditions.
The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model.
If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.

### Results

This is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.

Describe the key results from the model.
The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions.

### Grading summary

Grading of the project will take into account the following:

-   Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy of data to those questions?
-   Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?
-   Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, writing, and explanations?
-   Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?

A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:

-   *90%-100%*: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.
-   *80%-89%*: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.
-   *70%-79%*: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.
-   *60%-69%*: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.
-   *Below 60%*: Student is not making a sufficient effort.

### Late work policy

**There is no late work accepted on this project.** Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps.

## Example Project Ideas {#example-project-ideas}

- You took Philosphy 106 (ethics) and you discussed the relationship between employers and employees. You submitted a signature assignment of a paper on unions (pro or against, it doesn't matter). A possible dataset you could choose 
is the [Right to Work Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandonconrady/right-to-work-dataset) and do an analysis on the relationship between state laws and their effect on union participation.
- You took a BIO 101 class and discussed the biologcal mechanisms of diabetes. A possible dataset you could choose 
is the [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set ) and create a model that predict diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.
- You took ARTS 104 (Creativity: Methods and Practices). A possible dataset you could choose is the [Best Artworks of All Time](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time) and do a clustering analysis to see if there exists any patterns about great artists in our times (country, age, sex, etc.).
- You took SOCIO 101. A possible dataset you could choose is the [Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set) that looks at student achievement in secondary education. You could create a regression model that predicts performance based upon a variety of factors.
