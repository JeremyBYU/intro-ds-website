The data should broadly connect to topics you studied in Core Curriculum (first-year seminar, foundations for the future and understanding the world domains, and the themed explorations). The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.\nThis project will be your Core Capstone work. A Core Capstone Work is an assignment (or set of assignments) in students’ major capstone/seminar course where students integrate their Core Curriculum coursework with their major course work. Students will use their collected Signature Assignments (one assignment from each Core course, collected in Brightspace ePortfolios) to help in this work. This Core Capstone work will have size (6) deliverables that fulfill the learning outcomes of the Core Capstone."

All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients or behavrior are used to support the key findings and conclusions. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed including the use of RMSE or confusion matrices.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Please also inlcude an ending discussion of how your coursework has helped (or prepared) you to be a leader in service to others\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed.

Introduce your research question and data set, showcase visualizations, and discuss the primary conclusions. These slides should serve as a brief visual addition to your written report and will be graded for content and quality.\nYour slides should be Google Slides and be created in your shared Google Drive folder presentation-slides\nThe slide deck should have no more than 8 content slides + 1 title slide. Here is a suggested outline as you think through the slides; you do not have to use this exact format for the 8 slides.\n\nTitle Slide\nSlide 1: Introduce the topic and motivation\nSlide 2: Introduce the data\nSlide 3: Highlights from EDA\nSlide 4: Highlights from EDA\nSlide 5: Final model\nSlide 6: Final model\nSlide 7: Interesting findings from the model\nSlide 8: Conclusions + future work\n\nSubmission\nExport your slides as a PDF and submit to brightsapce"

Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n\nA general breakdown of scoring is as follows:\n\n90%-100%: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.\n80%-89%: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n70%-79%: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69%: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\nBelow 60%: Student is not making a sufficient effort.\n\n\n\nLate work policy\nThere is no late work accepted on this project. Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps."

The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\nTODO example plot\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."
