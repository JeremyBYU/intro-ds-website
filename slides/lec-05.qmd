# Inferential Statistics

## Main Ideas {.smaller}


- **Inferential statistics** are methods that result in *conclusions* and *estimates* about the population based on a *sample*
- Seek to *estimate* the **parameters** that describe a *populations* distribution
  - mean, std, etc.
- Remember, we collect data from a population, this creates a *sample*
- Using that sample, we make **inferences** about the underlying *population*
-  The sample proportion of voters who plan to vote by mail is a statistic and estimates the parameter, or the population proportion, of all voters who plan to vote by mail.


::: callout-warning
We will not go *too* deeply into this subject. We will only focus on the most important points.

## Sampling

- Because calculated statistics will vary from sample to sample due to natural sampling variability, statistics do not estimate parameters with 100% accuracy.
- The overall behavior of a statistic from repeated sampling is described by a **sampling distribution**.
- The sampling distribution of a statistic describes the statistic's possible values and a measure of how likely the values are to occur.

## Sampling Video

::: notes

Mean of many *means*

## Central Limit Theorem

::: callout-tip
The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that if random samples of size are drawn from a large population and is large enough, then the **sampling distribution** of the **sample mean** will follow approximately a *normal* distribution.
:::


# Hypothesis Testing


## Hypothesis Test {.smaller}


- **Hypothesis Test** - method for examining a claim, or hypothesis, about a population parameter.
- **null hypothesis**, $H_0$, by-chance, no-effect explanation
  - medicine has no effect
- **alternative hypothesis**, $H_a$, explanation of an effect
  - medicine has a (positive) effect
- **p-value** - or likelihood, of obtaining a statistic at least as extreme when $H_0$ is true.

::: callout-caution
Statistics is widely and notoriously misunderstood. Even by experts. Including me. 
:::


## Visualization

## Questions

1. A graph of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion of correct detections out of 37 trials when the null hypothesis is true is given below. Based on this graph, observing a sample proportion of 0.78 or greater is

2. Can the dog detect cancer?

::: fragment

::: callout-caution

This does not mean the dog detects cancer! This just means the dog is doing better than guessing!  Maybe cancer patients eat PB sandwiches and thats what the dog is smelling!

# Errors

## Type 1 and Type 2 Errors {.smaller}

- **Type 1 Error** - is rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative when in reality the null hypothesis is true.    
  - **False Positive**
- **Type 2 Error** - is failing to reject (accepting) the null hypothesis when in reality the alternative hypothesis is true.
  - **False Negative**

::: callout-tip

Binary Outcomes, True or False, 1 or 0

False-Positive = Incorrectly Predict a Positive Outcome

$$
\underbrace{\textbf{False}}_{\textbf{Correct or Incorrect}}-\underbrace{\textbf{Positive}}_{\textbf{Your Prediction}}
$$

:::


## Table

|                  | Actual Positive | Actual Negative |
|:----------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| Predict Positive |        TP       |    FP, Type I   |
| Predict Negative |   FN, Type II   |        TN       |



# Estimation

## Confidence Intervals

- Sometimes you want to estimate the value of a population parameter (e.g., the mean)
- **Confidence Interval** provides an interval of *possible* values for the parameter being estimated
  - *estimate* +- *margin of error*
- Margin of error includes 
  - the standard error, or measure of sampling variability
  - Confidence level, or measure of interval reliability. Usually set at 95%.


## Example

![](./lec05_images/estimation.png)

## Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution {.smaller}

- We don't usually have the standard deviation of sampling distribution.
- Estimate with the **Standard Error**
- $SD_{\hat{p}} = SD_{\bar{x}} = \sigma_{\bar{x}} = SEM$
- $SD_{\bar{p}} = \frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt{N}}$
  - $\sigma_x$ - This is the standard deviation of your samples
  - $N$ - How many samples you took

::: callout-tip
Use standard error when estimating means.
:::



# Inference for proportions and means

## Confirming reported statistic

::: incremental
- Given a statistic about a population, $\hat{\pi}$. Mean radon levels of houses in Iowa.
- You gather samples that are IID. Independent and identically distributed
- Compute the mean and standard deviation from your sample: $\hat{p}, \hat{\sigma}$
- $H_0$: The true population mean is $\hat{\pi}$. $\pi = \hat{\pi}$
- $H_a$: The true population mean is not $\hat{\pi}$. $\pi \neq \hat{\pi}$

::: callout-caution
What if we didn't gather that many samples, e.g., $< 30$? Then our sampling distribution follows a t-distribution.

# Conclusion

## Highlights

- **Inferential statistics** are methods that result in *conclusions* and *estimates* about the population based on a *sample*
- **Hypothesis Testing** - create a null hypothesis, gather data, compute sample statistics, compute z-score and generate p-value.
- **Confidence Interval** - sample data, compute sample statistics, use confidence multiplier (z-value) and standard deviation of samples to compute margin of error

## Whats next?

- Start playing more with data!
- Will be using the software `pandas` to help analyze the data
- Cleaning data
