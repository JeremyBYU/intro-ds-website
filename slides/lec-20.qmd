# SVM

## Terms

- **S**upport **V**ector **M**achine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm that uses *hyperplanes* to divide data into different classes. 
- **Hyperplane** is a flat surface that is *one* dimension lower than the input feature space.

:::incremental
- In a two-dimensional feature space, a hyperplane is a _____
- In a three-dimensional feature space, a hyperplane is a ____

## Advantages ans Disadntages

Advantages:

- Flexible
- Low storage required

Disadvantages:

- Prefers balanced data (we have workarounds)
- Many hyperparametes (very true)

## Margin

- A dataset is **well-separated** if a hyperplane can divide the dataset so that all the instances of one class fall on one side of the hyperplane, and all instances not in that class fall on the other side. 

- The **margin** is the space between the hyperplanes parallel to the dividing hyperplane that go through the dividing hyperplane's closest instances. W
hen a dataset is well-separated, SVM seeks to find the dividing hyperplane that has the widest margin. The closest instances to the hyperplane are the hyperplane's support vectors. The support vectors are the only instances that determine, or support, the hyperplane.
