# Review Unsupervised Learning


## Ideas

:::incremental
- What is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?
- What is the quintienstial example of unsupervised learning
  - clustering
- Names of some example clustering algs?
:::


## All clustering algs

## K-Means

::: incremental
- **Cluster** is a set of samples with *similar* or *dissimilar* characteristics?
- Grouping samples into classes with similar characteristics is called clustering. 
- **Centroid** ?
  - is a point that represents the *center* of each cluster. 
- Samples that are **closer** to a cluster's centroid are said to be similar to each other and considered part of the cluster.
- What do we mean by closer? Can you give a precise definition?
:::


## K-means Algorithm{.smaller}

:::incremental
- Step 0: Select the number of clusters, $k$.
- Step 1: Randomly initialize samples as cluster centroids.
- Step 2: For each sample, calculate the distance between that sample and each cluster's centroid, and assign the sample to the cluster with the closest centroid.
- Step 3: For each cluster, calculate the **mean** of all samples in the cluster. This mean becomes the **new** centroid.
-Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met. Such as reaching a certain number of iterations or the centroids staying the same. 
:::

## Choosing K

::: incremental
- The number of clusters is not often obvious, especially if the data has more than two features. 
- The **elbow** method is the most common technique to determine the optimal number of clusters for the data. 
- The intuition is that good groups should be *close* together.
- How can we measure how *close* things are together?
  - The sum of squared distanced between all samples and their centroid
  - **within-cluster sum of squares** - WCSS

# Peer Review

## Motivation

:::incremental
- Making the writing process more **collaborative**
- **Learn** from one another and to think carefully about the **role of writing in this course**
- Allows students to **clarify** your own ideas 
  - You explain your ideas to classmates and the reviewer formulates questions about your writing
- Peer review provides professional experience for you having your writing reviewed
- Peer review minimizes last minute drafting
