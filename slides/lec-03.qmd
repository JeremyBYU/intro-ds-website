# Data Collection

## Stats for data science

- Data science relies on statistics to make data driven decisions
- Sampling methods are used to efeciently collect data and reduce bias

::: {.callout-note .smaller}
**Bias** - anything that leads to a systematic difference between the true parameters of a population and the statistics used to estimate those parameters.  E.g., sampling only men.

## Stats for data science

:::: {.columns}

::: {.smaller .column width="40%"}
- Descriptive statistics -> explore visualizations
- Inferential statistics -> modeling and estimation
- Statisitcs is foundational to ensure results are interpreted correctly

## Sampling

- **Population** - Entire set of individuals, items, or events of interest
- **Observational Unit** - individual item or event
- **Sample** - *subset* of observational units from the population

## Types of Sampling

::: incremental
- Random Sampling
  - OU are selected at random
- Stratified Sampling
  - 
- Cluster Sampling
- Systematic Sampling
- Convenience Sampling
