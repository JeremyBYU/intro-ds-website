# Historical Overview

## Data Science

::: incremental
> Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on *discovering* **patterns** and *describing* **relationships** using data.


-   Data science uses techniques from computer science and statistics. 
-   Data scientists use computers to write code and store, modify, and visualize large datasets. 
-   Data scientists also build, test, and interpret models that describe real-life situations, then use models to make predictions for new data.

# Foundations of Data Science

## Learning Goals

- Identify **features** and **instances** in a dataset
- Three V's- **volume**, **velocity**, and **variety**

## Data sets

- A dataset is a collection of information.  Consists of features and instances
- A **feature**, or **variable**, is a characteristic that can be *measured* or *observed* on an observational unit.
- An **instance**, or observational units, is a tuple of features. Often called data points or observations.

## Example Data Set

```{python}
penguins = load_penguins()
penguins.head()
```

- **ROW** is an instance.
- **COLUMN** represents a different feature.

::: {.notes}

- Researchers at the Palmer Archipelago in the Antarctic collected data on three local penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.
:::


## **Volume**, Variety, Velocity 

- **Volume** - The amount of data being collected digitally is exponentially increasing.
- Billions of people are being digitally indexed and catalogued
- Estimate that 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created each day
- We now have the processing power where large data sets can now be processed

::: {.notes}
- Big data is really, really big. In 1986, the total estimated data in the world was 2.6 exabytes (EB).
- One exabyte (EB) equals
bytes, or 1 million TB. Most laptops come with 1 TB storage at most.
- By 1993, the total estimated data in the world had grown to 15.8 EB.
- In 2000, the total estimated data in the world had reached 54.5 EB.
- In 2007, the total estimated data in the world was 295 EB.
- By 2020, the total estimated data had increased to 6800 EB, or 6.8 PB - the equivalent of over 7 trillion laptop computers.
:::

## Volume, **Variety**, Velocity

- **Variety** - Data from a variety of difference sources are being collected and combined
- Its not just your name and your playlist.
  - Its how long you listened
  - How long it took you swipe next
  - Your search history on the subject
  - Your bloody e-mails
  - Your phones resolution, battery information, browser, time zone


## Volume, Variety, **Velocity**

- **Velocity** - Data is being created and ingested at a faster time
- The search you just made was fed into an algorithm to give you an add within 10 seconds
- Sensor Data - Your recorded heart rate was just noted and used to indicate the statistical likelihood of sending you an add now or later 
- With more up to date information, data scientist can make better predictions


## Reproducibility

::: {.incremental}

- Two data scientists are building models to classify brain tumors as benign or malignant.
- One data scientist uses a programming language, such as Python, to write code to fit the model.
- Another data scientist uses software instead of coding to fit the model.
- New brain scans arrive. The data scientist who used coding re-runs the analysis -> a few minutes.
- Since the software uses a point and click interface, re-analyzing could take several hours.

## Cleaning Data - After {.scrollable}

<div data-prevent-swipe>
```{python}
df = load_penguins()
df.head()
```
</div>

## Exploring Data

```{python}
g = sns.boxplot(x = 'island',
            y ='body_mass_g',
            hue = 'species',
            data = penguins,
            palette=['#FF8C00','#159090','#A034F0'],
            linewidth=0.3)
g.set_xlabel('Island')
g.set_ylabel('Body Mass');
```

## Modelling Data

<div data-prevent-swipe>
```{python}
g = sns.lmplot(x="flipper_length_mm",
               y="body_mass_g",
               hue="species",
               data=penguins,
               palette=['#FF8C00','#159090','#A034F0'],
               aspect=1.5)
g.set_xlabels('Flipper Length')
g.set_ylabels('Body Mass');
```
</div>

## Interpreting Data

- There is a linear relationship between flipper length and body length
- Gentoo penguins have significantly higher body length and body mass then Adelie or Chinstrap.
- etc.
