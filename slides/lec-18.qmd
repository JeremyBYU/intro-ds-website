## Schedule

- Reading 7-2:  Mar 31 @ 12PM, Friday
- Reading 7-3:  Apr 5 @ 12PM, Wednesday
- [HW6]() - Working on it... April 12 @ Midnight, Wednesday

## Today

- Short Review
- Naive Bayes
- Class Activity

# Review

## Terms

- An instance is **labeled** if 
- **Supervised learning** is 
- Regression vs Classification?
- What does KNN stand for?


# Naive Bayes

## Bascic Idea

- Naive Bayes classification is a supervised learning classifier that uses the number of times a feature occurs in each possible class to estimate the **likelihood** an instance is in the class. 
- Naive Bayes is often used for applications with large amounts of text data. 
  - identifying the author of a new document based on prior documents with known authors.
  - detecting spam emails
