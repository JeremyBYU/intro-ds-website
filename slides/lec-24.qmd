# Peer Review

## My Review

- Overall we did a great job! You can find my and your peers feedback on Brightspace.
  - Its also inside your *shared* Google Drive folder under **PeerReview**
- I particularly appreciated the detailed walkthrough that many of you did.
- It was very interesting seeing all your ideas!
- I did see a few common errors that I wanted to bring up.

## Common Issues 1

- Don't have empty cells.
- Donâ€™t have grammatical errors.
- Label all your axes in your figures.
- The primary goal of this paper is to create a **predictive model**. 
  - You need to be clear in your **introduction** what your response variable is and if you are doing **classification** or **regression**.

## Common Issues 2

- Be sure to have a good amount of detail in your report that explains **WHY** you are doing what you are doing.
- I recommend making tables showing your results. You can do this by creating a data frame of your results or by using [this website]( https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables ) to make markdown tables.
- Please review [this document](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bebi103a/bebi103a.github.io/blob/master/lessons/00/intro_to_latex.ipynb) to learn how to write equations in google collab.

## Common Issues 3

- If you are doing regression, please make [Residual Plots](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/regressor/residuals.html) and report $R^2$ metric.
- If you are doing classification, please report metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score.


# Hierarchical clustering


## Types of Clustering

- **Agglomerative** hierarchical clustering is _______
- **Divisive** hierarchical clustering is ____

## Measures of Similarity

- The **single linkage** method calculates the distance between a pair of samples, one from each cluster, that are the _____.
- The **complete linkage** method calculates the distance between a pair of samples, one from each cluster, that are the _____.
- The **centroid linkage** method calculates the distance between the ________ of two clusters.
